# IQParc-Quantum-Game-Club-Qsharp

This repository catalogs some of the learning materials I have created over the past year for the Purdue Quantum Game Club.
Solutions and explanations to some of these problems can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHf-9SnrIMOyATTlmaC-qJOqswsaj7elE).

In order to begin you will need to go through the process of installing Q#, Jupyter Notebooks. You may also wish to install VScode as it currently has the best support for Q# jupyter notebooks.
