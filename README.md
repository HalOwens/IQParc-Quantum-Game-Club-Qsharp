# IQParc-Quantum-Game-Club-Qsharp

In the contained notebook file you will find 8 different problems which will test your Q# abilities. Solutions and explanations to problems 1, 3, 4, and 6 can be found on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHf-9SnrIMOyATTlmaC-qJOqswsaj7elE).

In order to begin you will need to go through the process of installing Q#, Jupyter Notebooks. You may also wish to install VScode as it currently has the best support for Q# jupyter notebooks.
